OVERVIEW OF THE PROJECT
This project is about predicting housing prices in California using a Linear Regression model. We use California Housing dataset, which provides various features such as median income, house age, and average rooms per household. Here's an overview of the steps and objectives of the project:

1. Objective
To predict the housing prices in different areas of California based on a few influential factors, such as median income, house age, and average rooms. By analyzing these features, we aim to build a linear regression model that estimates housing prices and evaluates its performance.

2. Dataset Overview
-The California Housing dataset** is a well-known dataset in the machine learning community 
 for regression tasks. It includes information about:
-Median Income (`MedInc`): Median income of households.
-House Age (`HouseAge`): The average age of houses in a particular block.
-Average Rooms (`AveRooms`): Average number of rooms per household.
-The target variable is housing price (`PRICE`), representing the median house price for each block in thousands of dollars.

3.Data Preparation
-Feature Selection: The features chosen are 'MedInc,' 'HouseAge,' and 'AveRooms' based on their correlation with the target variable (`PRICE`).
-Train-Test Split: The dataset is split into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets to allow for evaluation on unseen data.

4.Modeling
-Linear Regression Model: We apply a basic linear regression model, which assumes a linear relationship between the features and the target.
-Training: The model learns to fit the training data by minimizing the mean squared error (MSE).

5.Evaluation
-We assess the model’s performance using two key metrics:
-Mean Squared Error (MSE): Measures the average squared difference between predicted and actual values. Lower values indicate better performance.
-R-squared (`R^2`): Shows how well the variance in the target is explained by the features. Values closer to 1 indicate a better fit.
-Visualization: A scatter plot of actual vs. predicted prices helps visualize the model’s predictions, with a diagonal reference line for perfect prediction.

6.Feature Importance
-We output the model's coefficients for each feature, showing the influence of each variable on housing prices. Higher coefficients indicate a stronger impact on the price.

7.Insights and Conclusion
-This project offers insights into how different features influence California housing prices, helping understand the real estate market better.
-The model can be expanded by adding more features or experimenting with different types of regression or machine learning algorithms if a higher level of accuracy is required.

This project is a fundamental machine learning application, showcasing data preparation, model training, evaluation, and interpretation through a real-world scenario of housing price prediction. Let me know if you need further details or have any questions!
